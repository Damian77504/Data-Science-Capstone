Goal of the App is to predict the next word of the user input sentence. Applied following rules for algorithm prediction: 
       1. For prediction of the next word, Quadgram is first used (first three words of Quadgram are the last three words of the user provided sentence).
       2. If no Quadgram is found, back off to Trigram (first two words of Trigram are the last two words of the sentence).
       3. If no Trigram is found, back off to Bigram (first word of Bigram is the last word of the sentence)
       4. If no Bigram is found, back off to the most common word with highest frequency 'the' is returned.
